# 🩺 Physician Notetaker – NLP Pipeline

![Physician Notetaker](images/doctor.png)

## 📌 Project Overview
Physician Notetaker is an AI-powered NLP system designed to process doctor–patient medical conversations and transform unstructured text into structured clinical information. The project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer-based models can be applied for:

- Medical data extraction  
- Patient sentiment and intent analysis  
- Automated SOAP note generation  

This project was developed as part of an **AI Engineer Intern assignment**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extract key medical details from conversation transcripts  
- Analyze patient sentiment and intent  
- Generate structured clinical documentation (SOAP Notes)  

---

## 🧠 Features Implemented

### 1️⃣ Medical NLP Summarization
- Extracts:
  - Symptoms  
  - Diagnosis  
  - Treatment  
  - Prognosis  
- Techniques:
  - **spaCy** for sentence processing  
  - Rule-based keyword matching  
  - **KeyBERT** for keyword extraction  
- Output: Structured medical data in JSON format  

### 2️⃣ Sentiment & Intent Analysis
- Model: HuggingFace Transformers (DistilBERT)  
- Sentiment classification:
  - Anxious  
  - Neutral  
  - Reassured  
- Intent detection:
  - Seeking reassurance  
  - Reporting symptoms  
  - Reassured  

### 3️⃣ SOAP Note Generation (Bonus Feature)
Automatically converts transcripts into a SOAP Note:

- **Subjective** – Patient symptoms and history  
- **Objective** – Physical examination findings  
- **Assessment** – Diagnosis and condition severity  
- **Plan** – Treatment plan and follow-up instructions  

Output: Structured JSON format SOAP notes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- spaCy  
- HuggingFace Transformers  
- KeyBERT  
- PyTorch  
- scikit-learn  

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install Required Libraries

pip install spacy transformers torch keybert scikit-learn
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

## 2️⃣ Run the Project

1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Run all cells sequentially.  
3. The final outputs will include:  
   - **Medical Summary (JSON)**  
   - **Sentiment & Intent (JSON)**  
   - **SOAP Note (JSON)**  

---

### 📝 Design Notes
- Rule-based techniques used for medical entity extraction (simplicity-focused)  
- Pre-trained transformer models applied without fine-tuning  
- Project emphasizes **pipeline design**, not clinical deployment  
- Easily extendable with fine-tuned medical NLP models  

---

### 🚀 Future Improvements
- Fine-tune BERT on medical datasets  
- Use clinical NLP models like **BioBERT** or **ClinicalBERT**  
- Improve NER accuracy using medical ontologies  
- Add **speech-to-text support** for real-time transcription
